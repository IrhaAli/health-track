# Health Track Application

## Description
The Health Track application is a mobile app built using Expo, designed to empower users to monitor and manage their health and fitness goals. With an intuitive and user-friendly interface, it provides tools for tracking daily physical activity, nutrition, sleep, heart rate, blood pressure, and other health metrics, helping users lead healthier lifestyles through personalized goal setting and data insights.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`)
- A mobile device with the Expo Go app or an emulator (Android/iOS) for testing

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-track.git
   cd health-track
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any required environment variables (e.g., API keys for health services or analytics):
   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Expo Development Server**
   Launch the development server:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

2. **Open on Device or Emulator**
   - On a mobile device, use the **Expo Go app** to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.
   - Alternatively, in the Expo Developer Tools (browser), press `a` to open in an Android emulator or `i` for an iOS simulator.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `assets/` - Images, fonts, and other static assets.
- `components/` - Reusable React components for the UI (e.g., ActivityTracker, NutritionLog).
- `screens/` - Main app screens (e.g., HomeScreen, ProfileScreen).
- `navigation/` - Navigation configuration for the app.
- `services/` - API calls and data services for health tracking.
- `utils/` - Utility functions.
- `App.tsx` - The main application entry point.

## Features
- **Activity Tracking**: Log steps, exercise routines, and calories burned.
- **Health Monitoring**: Track heart rate, blood pressure, and sleep patterns.
- **Nutrition Logging**: Record food intake and gain nutritional insights.
- **Sleep Analysis**: Monitor sleep duration and patterns.
- **Goal Setting**: Set and track personalized health and fitness goals.
- **Data Visualization**: View health metrics through charts and graphs.
- **Notifications**: Receive reminders for workouts, medication, and hydration.

## Technologies Used
- **Expo**: Cross-platform framework for React Native development.
- **React Native**: Core framework for building the user interface.
- **Expo SDK**: Provides features like push notifications and camera access.
- **Firebase**: Backend services for authentication and data storage.
